rpm (4.11.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Since 4.11.2 rpm is more strict about using - in version or release
  name. The version in Debian is patched to emit only warning on this,
  but this patch will disappear in future releases, so please adjust
  your spec files accordingly. The same approach was taken by Fedora 20,
  so we try to stay compatible with upstream by this.
