    - Tell automake to add missing files and force update of standard files.
    - Remove bogus code to link the rpmio code to libbeecrypt statically to
      the PIC code and just use a convenience library instead.

rpm (4.0.4-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Turn off libtool's suppress_output feature, which is intended to
    hide duplicate compiler errors during the second compilation of files,

rpm (4.0.4-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-dep on libtool1.4 for now. libtool 1.5 does not like the way rpmio

    wait on the new upstream version of rpm. Closes: #208390

  * Conflict against packages in woody linked with librpm-4.0.3.so, which is
    not provided, although librpm4's soname did not change, to prevent upgrade
    problems. Closes: #178371 This is certianly not ideal, see #177298
  * Pirenially broken automake/autoconf jiggery of the hour. This now includes
    running autoconf twice, because it is not even *idempotent*. Gah.

rpm (4.0.4-14) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Minor security fixes spotted by Paul Szabo.
    - cpanflute: check mkdir call and abort on failure
    - cross-build: drop the files into ~/srpms/done, not /tmp/srpms/done; but
      of course this is just an example script like it says
    - rpmdiff.cgi: like so many CGI scripts, this is utter insecure crap (use
      viewcvs); removed from binary package. Added note that it is completly
      insecure to source and make it die on startup. (Maximum impact:
      executation of arbitrary code as user cgi script runs as.)
    - vpkg-provides.sh, vpkg-provides2.sh: Use tempfile(1) for safe creation
      of all temporary files. Many changes and untested. These scripts do not
      work on linux anyway.
    None of the above programs were ever run by rpm when building packages.
    Therefore these security holes are unlikely to have impacted casual RPM
    users.
    Closes: #173242 (also sent upstream)

rpm (4.0.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

rpm (4.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Includes crypto. I had to link beecrypt statically from the sources in
    rpm, rather than using the debian one, since rpm uses beecrypt internal
    functions. Sigh.
  * Still using internal popt, as it has functions not in the debian one.
  * Updated copyright file.
  * Hacked around more automake crap, this time involving use of += vs =
  * Get rid of dh_movefiles and use dh_install instead; much better.

 -- Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>  Sat,  6 Apr 2002 12:55:27 -0500

rpm (4.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a rpm-lsb package. Closes: #108059
    This is for building lsb packages, it will always generate v3 packages
    and it is statically linked for the lsbdev chroot. It will be used by
    the soon forthcoming lsbdev package.
  * Removed unnecessary old dependency on bzip2.

rpm (4.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched header.h and rpmdb.h to #include <rpm/blah>, so they can be
    #included from the installed librpm-dev package.
  * Make librpm-dev provide librpm0-dev, for back-compatability.
  * Use debhelper v4 (for dh_makeshlibs -V saneness).
  * Make librpm-dev depend on libdm3-dev; you need to link with db3 to link
    in librpmdb. Closes: #128299

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Jan 2002 23:41:36 -0500

rpm (4.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It does not make sense for rpm to check BuildPrereq's on debian systems,
    which lack a rpm db. So, hacked the rpmpopt file to add --nodeps to all
    invocations of rpmb. Closes: #119591

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Jan 2002 15:27:55 -0500

rpm (4.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "where did that soname come from?" release.
  * So there's a soname now, but it's ugly as sin. Renamed the lib package
    to librpm4, but the soname is really "librpm-4.0.3".
  * I also took this opportunity to remove a version from the librpm-dev
    package. There can only be one, I hope.
  * This includes Perl-RPM, and if someone needs a librpm-perl package to be
    built, just ask.
  * Building with the popt in rpm again instead of debian's, which is too
    old. This bloats rpm a lot, and I hope for a better resolution soon.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Dec 2001 16:26:15 -0500

rpm (4.0.2-18) unstable; urgency=HIGH

  * Applied a patch dug out of a connectiva .src.rpm, that appears to fix
    a bug that could allow arbitrary code to execute when rpm was used to
    query a malicious package. Hard to check since there is no known exploit
    and since no real technical information about the hole has been publically
    posted.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 12:06:46 -0500

rpm (4.0.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "automake considered harmful" release.
  * Modified various random things in Makefile.am's and the automake
    invocation, that somehow make it build with autoconf 1.5.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Oct 2001 20:05:53 -0400

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jul 2001 12:26:22 -0400

rpm (4.0.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deal with /usr/src/redhat having arbitratry contents, including whole
    build trees, when doing the move. Closes: #103236

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  2 Jul 2001 19:20:38 -0400

rpm (4.0.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed /usr/src/redhat directory, which recent versions of autoconf
    had begin changing to /usr/src/pc. This seems to be coming from
    '<arch>-pc-linux-gnu' (just guessing, it is all too horrific to track
    down). Anyway, it seems in the configure.in that they actually are
    making some effort to make it be /usr/src/<distro>, for rpm-derived
    distributions. Since using /usr/src/debian for rpm on debian is too
    evil to be believed, I have made it use /usr/src/rpm for debian.
  * Of course, a lot of docs refer to /usr/src/redhat/. Added something to
    README.Debian about it.
  * Contents of existing /usr/src/redhat directories will be moved
    into /usr/src/rpm on upgrade.

rpm (4.0.2-3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As libpopt0 is now maintained, stop linking it in statically, or
    compiling it. (Fixes: #95082)
  * Something odd happens with dh_installdocs if you specify globs on

rpm (4.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the package from extra to optional. Alien is in optional, and
    that is the right place for it too by my reading of policy. The only
    reason rpm was in extra was because it only seemed useful to those with
    specialized requirements (debian users don't need to fiddle with rpms,
    right?) Well, running alien is not a particularly specialized
    requirement. (I've kept the -dev package in extra though.)

rpm (4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Closes: #75189
  * Build-depends on db3.
  * The lib and dev packages have changed to librpm0 from librpm1. Yes,
    this is counterintuitive, but librpm1 was a mistake from the beginning;
    the lib is still 0.0.0, and I'm sure the interface has changed.

rpm (3.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

    /usr/include. Closes: #58839

rpm (3.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * If /etc/rpmrc is still around, kill it. I think it's lingering on in
    some systems, because it used to not be a conffile, then became a
    conffile, and then was removed entirely. Probably upgrades from the
    not-a-conffile state direct to the current state fail to delete it.
  * Make sure /etc/rpm/macros is deleted on purge. (It's generated in some
    cases by convertrpmrc.sh.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Feb 1997 23:37:36 -0500

rpm (2.3.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Previous version forgot to include rpm binary!
  * Uncommented some lines in /usr/lib/rpmrc that got commented by mistake
    because I had an old version of rpm installed in /usr/local/bin. Whoops.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 1 Feb 1997 22:39:28 -0500

  * Repackaged with newest debmake
  * The last changelog entry was not correct. There was no a.out library but
    Red Hat did something rather strange to construct a .a library composed
    of a lot of objectfiles. Might have had something to do with the
    independance of rpm from installed libraries (which is not necessary in
    the debian situation).
